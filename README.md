## CSS for Anki Korean Vocab Deck

These are the CSS and templates for my Korean vocab deck. I mainly import entries from [HTSK](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/) and supplement with dictionary info or sentence mining.

This deck template works best with Google TTS through the [AwesomeTTS extension](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454).

The deck uses [the awesome Balloon.css pure css tooltip library](https://github.com/kazzkiq/balloon.css), as well as [Noto CJK KR](https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/cjk/) and [Nanum Brush Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Brush+Script) fonts.
